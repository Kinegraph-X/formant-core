
#Formant: Fast & Efficient Frontend Framework

Welcome to Formant – the JavaScript framework designed for instant display, and easy frontend development. We developed it to say goodbye to sluggish apps and tangled code. It's still experimental, but give a try to the demos, you'll be surprised.

##Advantages at a Glance

⚡ Speed: Fast rendering and responsiveness. Our first feedback were just : "Oh it's fast!".

⏩ Asynchronous DOM Rendering: The rendering embraces the browser's async capabilities. Smooth and efficient. No VDOM cumbersomness.

📦 Clean Separation: Model, view, controller and styles, all separated, all Javascript – No separation of languages, but just organized coding. No HTML in the code of the controler, no variables spread all around the code of the view.

🎨 Stylesheet API: An embedded API fills the browser's stylesheet API gaps, giving you more design control. And as it's become a standard, scoped-CSS on demand with an automated intanciation as shadow-DOM, web-component-based to be reachable from outside the code, CSSOM-ready support.

🔌 Fully Reactive: Seamless data-driven UI updates.

🚀 No Transpilation Needed: Dive straight into coding. You are fully responsible of the code you run, you can read it, and it's optimized "at writing time".

🎮 Experimental Raster Engine: Unlock creative potential with an innovative and cross-platform approach to rendering.

##Tailored for Specialized Apps

Formant is perfect for apps that demand instant updates. Think lengthy tables, data-rich visualizations, and captivating graphics. From data dashboards to real-time analytics – Formant plays its role as a reliable platform, and relieves you from fearing bottlenecks.
